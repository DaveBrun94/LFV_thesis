The Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) is the description of the physics of elementary particles and their interaction, which is known up now. The theoretical foundation is the perturbative quantum field theory (QFT) which is harmonised with Special Relativity. In the formaslim of QFT classical fields are quantized and the information of the interaction of the particles is encoded in the lorentz-invariant lagrangian density $\mathcal{L}$.
